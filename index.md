C# code generator for serialization into [Googles Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/docs/overview.html) wire format.

Parses a .proto file and generates C# source files
with classes for every message as well as code for
reading and writing them to the Protocol Buffers binary format.

## Basic Features

 * CodeGenerator - transform a .proto specification directly into complete c# code.
 * Generated code is relatively easy to debug(only hope you won't have too)
 * Generated code does not use reflection, works after code obfuscation.
